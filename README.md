# Todoist PHP SDK

This project is a **non-official** PHP implementation of the [Todoist REST API](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2).

The main concept turns around the idea of representing the different endpoints and resource as PHP objects, providing an
OOP interface.

This project is currently in development - and updated Readme and documentation will follow as soon as possible.
